# E-sheba Landing (React + Vite)

This project is a lightweight React implementation of the provided landing page design. Images were intentionally ignored — placeholders and CSS are used instead.

Quick start (PowerShell):

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build:

```powershell
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Files:
- `index.html` — entry
- `src/` — React source

Notes:
- The UI is responsive and built with plain CSS. You can replace placeholders with real images later.
